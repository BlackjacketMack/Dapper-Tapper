Dapper-Tapper
=============

Tapper adds fun and useful functionality to Dapper.  
We're porting this over from several projects, standardizing it and cleaning it up in the process.  

* QueryMapper - (ported) - Adds portable mapping definitions to objects without requiring <T1-T7> overloads.
* TableT/Database - (not ported yet) - Adds simple table structures and an expressive Sql Command library including the ability to add sql to standard expressions (e.g. INSERT INTO...WHERE id = @id AND (PartitionID = @partitionID)).
